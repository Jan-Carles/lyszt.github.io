# Knowing How to "Sell" Your Research: The Importance of Design in Academic Papers

Knowing how to sell is one particularly important aspect of anything you do, write or create. There is no better way than convincing your customer that you product is top-notch than doing so by using aesthetics and design. Research shows that 75% of a consumer's judgment about a product is based on its appearance, with design playing a crucial role in influencing purchasing decisions (Source: Adobe). Furthermore, products with good aesthetics are often perceived as higher quality and more valuable, leading to a 30% increase in consumer engagement and a 20% higher likelihood of purchase (Source: Forbes). So, it becomes obvious: beauty doesn’t just apply to businesses and trade, it’s actually present everywhere. When you go for a job interview, when you try to convince your friend to come join your Minecraft server and build with you, or, as is the subject of this blog post, when you’re writing an article, a research paper, and you want to ** get your paper published **.
But the principle of "design" extends beyond business. It influences how we present ideas, persuade others, and communicate messages.

In scientific writing, design also plays a pivotal role in shaping how your work is perceived. The layout of a research paper, the clarity of figures, and the use of visual elements such as graphs or tables can significantly impact how readers engage with the content. Studies have shown that beautiful scientific articles are more likely to be cited and have higher readership. A paper that is easy to navigate, with visually appealing formatting and concise, well-structured sections, encourages readers to engage more deeply. Poor design, on the other hand, can lead to misunderstandings or cause readers to disengage prematurely, undermining the impact of even the most groundbreaking research.

# UI/UX in Scientific Writing: Clarifying the Role of Design
With this said, it might also be important to consider that figures are ought to pass down a message. Don’t use figures nonsensically, use them to reinforce an idea or increase understanding. It’s basically UI/UX—User Interface and User Experience—which, although primarily associated with digital products, is just as relevant when presenting academic work. UI refers to the design elements that help structure the content and make it easy to navigate, while UX focuses on ensuring a positive experience for the reader, allowing them to engage with the material efficiently and intuitively. Every figure should reinforce an idea, clarify a concept, or provide additional insight into your research. In this way, the integration of UI/UX principles in your paper’s design not only improves the presentation but also enhances the reader's understanding and engagement with the content."
- **UI (User Interface)** refers to the design elements that make content easy to navigate and interact with. In a research paper, this includes how well the text, figures, graphs, and tables are organized, the consistency of formatting, and how readable the paper is as a whole.
- **UX (User Experience)** focuses on ensuring that the reader has a positive, efficient experience when engaging with the paper. It's about making sure that the information flows logically, the figures are intuitive, and the design helps the reader to grasp the content easily. A positive UX in a research paper means the reader can focus on understanding the research without being distracted by confusing layouts or poorly presented data.
Another valuable way to refine the UX of your research paper is to gather feedback through user testing. Just as companies conduct A/B testing to understand how different versions of a product resonate with their audience, you can apply a similar approach to your paper by showing it to friends, colleagues, or even unfamiliar readers. This external feedback can highlight areas where the flow or design of your paper might be confusing, too dense, or difficult to follow. By making adjustments based on their input, you can improve the overall user experience of your paper, ensuring that your ideas are communicated as clearly and effectively as possible.

I’d like to mention one good scientific article designer, Colin Ophus. (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.09134) He makes good choices of colours and remarkably interesting designs that connect well to a paper that might be considered quite complex (Multibeam Electron Diffraction). The figures help the reader understand and visualize those not so easy to comprehend ideas, and that’s what figures are all about!

But what to use in order to create the best possible articles? Now that we’ve established the importance of design, here are some tools to help you create high-quality visuals for your paper:

-  For 3D modeling, Blender is an excellent open-source tool that allows you to create detailed, high-quality visual representations of complex concepts.
- Python offers a range of libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating dynamic, customizable charts and graphs that can effectively convey statistical information.
- If you're looking for something more advanced, Unity or Unreal Engine can be used for immersive 3D visualizations that could turn your research into an interactive experience. With this, your crush your competitors.
- Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign) is a great tool for refining layouts, creating clean vector graphics, and designing polished figures. Am I going too far?
- But you don't need to go all-in on professionality. Canva is super easy and has tons of templates to make graphs and images look polished without much work.
- Google Sheets or Excel can help you whip up some charts and graphs to show off your numbers. Automatic, mind you.
Here's the complete list if you're an advanced user and want the best stuff there is. You can go look for it.
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Bokeh, Mayavi, Dask, Pandas, TensorFlow, PyTorch, PyOpenGL, Pygame, Unity with Python for Unity, VTK, Mayavi, Unreal Engine with Python scripting, Dash, Streamlit.
