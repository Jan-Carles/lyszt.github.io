## I designed this logo, which is now used across MACTAB’s branding.
MACTAB specializes in manufacturing industrial partitions for floors and ceilings, offering corporate solutions that optimize space with a blend of technology, aesthetics, acoustics, and innovation. The logo and brand design were created using pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.


## Web Design & UX
The user interface I developed for MACTAB allows for intuitive customization of partitions, offering a range of fabric options, panels, and finishes to match any style or requirement. Users can effortlessly select textures and customize features such as locks, blinds, handles, and glass details. This clean, user-friendly design not only enhances functionality but also emphasizes aesthetics, making it a key piece in my portfolio.

## Publicity and Social Media Design
I am proud to present several artworks related to this project, including various designs and product photography. These visuals were crafted to complement MACTAB’s identity and marketing efforts.
