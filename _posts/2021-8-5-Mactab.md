MACTAB specializes in manufacturing industrial partitions for floors and ceilings, offering corporate solutions that optimize space with a blend of technology, aesthetics, acoustics, and innovation. The logo and brand design were created using pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
>   I designed this logo, which is now used across MACTAB’s branding.

The user interface I developed for MACTAB allows for
intuitive customization of partitions, offering a
range of fabric options, panels, and finishes to
match any style or requirement. Users can
effortlessly select textures and customize
features such as locks, blinds, handles, and glass
details. This clean, user-friendly design not only
enhances functionality but also emphasizes aesthetics,
making it a key piece in my portfolio.
