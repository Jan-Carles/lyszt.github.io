MACTAB is a manufacturer of industrial floor-ceiling partitions
and corporate solutions focused on dividing and organizing environments through products that combine technology, aesthetics, acoustics and innovation.
Made using pure Javascript, HTML & CSS.

The user interface allows for easy personalization of cabins, offering a variety of fabrics and panels to suit any style and need. Users can seamlessly choose from different textures and finishes, as well as customize details such as locks, blinds, handles, and glass. This design showcases a user-friendly approach to creating tailored spaces, emphasizing both functionality and aesthetics, and is an essential addition to my portfolio.
