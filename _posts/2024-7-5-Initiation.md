"La semplicità, è l'ultima sofisticazione." This beautiful quote, often attributed to Leonardo da Vinci, reflects a timeless truth in design, even though some experts suggest it might not have been his words. Regardless of its origin, the essence of the quote deeply influences my approach to design.
Simplicity, to me, is not just a design choice; it is a philosophy. It brings a sense of peace, of order, it muffles the chaos from everyday life away.

  I have made this website and this blog, and despite feeling very motivated to write, I fear that I have nothing to write about in the first place. Through this platform, I shall manifest my ideas and try to find meaning
 in the things that I create, and act as a critic. Be the voice that will praise and hate my work when at times, there is nobody else to look and opinionate.
