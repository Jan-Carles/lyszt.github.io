Lygon Xin is dedicated to my videography and design projects,
and all the portfolio related to it was created to suit a variety of clients.
I’ve worked on various projects, including branding,
video editing, web
design and development, etc. All design elements
are built using modern tools like After Effects, Premiere Pro, and Adobe Illustrator.
>  The first versions were Lygon's brand were made in 2014.

Lygon Xin has worked extensively with influencers venturing into the entertainment industry. Promotional videos, vlogs, or engaging visual content, we’ve helped influencers build their personal brand and stand out in a competitive market.
It has also provided videography services
to companies across Canada and the United States.
These projects included corporate branding videos,
promotional content, and internal communications,
all designed to reflect each client’s identity.

With Lygon, I also work on projects that aren't so much on the professional side,
works related to entertainment, animated series and comics and the alike.
One example is Chodo and Deton,a YouTube miniseries. It has an extremely nonsense story which
involves immortality, clone-making and multiverse traveling stuff.
