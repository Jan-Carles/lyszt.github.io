## I created the Lygon Xin brand to embody versatility and creative innovation. It has 10 years of history, and its first versions were made in 2013.
Lygon Xin is dedicated to my videography and design projects, merging my personal portfolio with client-based work. I’ve worked on projects ranging from branding and web design for companies to directing and producing short films and animated series. The logo, designed with a minimalistic yet dynamic aesthetic, reflects the adaptable and bold nature of the Lygon Xin brand. All design elements are built using modern tools like After Effects, Premiere Pro, and Adobe Illustrator.

## Influencer Collaborations
Lygon Xin has worked extensively with influencers venturing into the entertainment industry. Whether it’s creating dynamic promotional videos, vlogs, or engaging visual content, we’ve helped influencers build their personal brand and stand out in a competitive market. Each video is tailored to capture the unique personality of the client, allowing them to connect deeply with their audience.

## Corporate Videos for International Clients
Lygon Xin has also provided videography services to companies across Canada and the United States. These projects included corporate branding videos, promotional content, and internal communications, all designed to reflect each client’s identity and values. From tech startups to well-established brands, Lygon Xin’s work has resonated with a broad audience, enhancing its reputation as a versatile creator.

## Shadow: The YouTube Miniseries

One of Lygon Xin’s most entertaining and off-the-wall creations is Shadow, a hilarious and bizarre YouTube miniseries about a journalist who doesn’t just cover the news—he makes it. Shadow, the main character, does everything from blowing up buildings and becoming a dictator, to forcing his face into every movie in existence. And just when you think things can't get weirder, Shadow suddenly discovers he's immortal, and multiple clones of him start popping into his dimension for absolutely no reason.

The show embraces chaos and nonsense, with Shadow’s outrageous antics often backfiring in the most unexpected and hilarious ways. It's a wild ride where logic takes a backseat, and anything can happen.


Shadow: Where nonsense reigns and chaos is just another Tuesday.
Shadow is an absurd and fun-filled journey through the life of a chaotic journalist who can’t seem to stay out of trouble—or control his clones. From ridiculous plot twists like immortality to over-the-top action scenes, this miniseries is all about having fun and letting the craziness unfold.
