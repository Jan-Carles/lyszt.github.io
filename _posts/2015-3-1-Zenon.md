## Website for Blade Zenon: A website for a MMORPG project from 2015
As a 13-year-old aspiring game developer, I launched an online forum for a game I was passionately working on using Unity. This forum became a community hub for over 100 active members. Although the game itself never reached publication, the experience of developing this project and managing the community was invaluable.

The forum served as a central platform where players could discuss game mechanics, share feedback, and collaborate on ideas.
