> Website for Blade Zenon: A website for a MMORPG project from 2015

As a 13-year-old aspiring game developer, I launched an online forum for a game I was passionately working on using Unity. This forum became a community hub for over 100 active members. Although the game itself never reached publication, the experience of developing this project and managing the community was invaluable.

Blade Zenon was an online game that featured a community-driven environment, where players could engage in various activities such as forming guilds and participating in discussions about game lore and mechanics.

The forum served as a central platform where players could discuss game mechanics, share feedback, and collaborate on ideas.
Players are encouraged to contribute ideas for game development and lore through public boards. This collaborative approach allowed players to feel a sense of ownership over the game's evolution.
