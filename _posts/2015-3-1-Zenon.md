## Website for Blade Zenon: A website for a MMORPG project from 2015
As a 13-year-old aspiring game developer, I launched an online forum for a game I was passionately working on using Unity. This forum became a vibrant community hub for over 100 active members who shared my enthusiasm and commitment to the game. Although the game itself never reached publication, the experience of developing this project and managing the community was invaluable, shaping my early understanding of game design and online interaction.

The forum served as a central platform where players could discuss game mechanics, share feedback, and collaborate on ideas. I facilitated discussions, organized events, and implemented community-driven initiatives to foster engagement and excitement around the game. The sense of camaraderie among members was inspiring, and it reinforced my belief in the power of collaborative creativity.
